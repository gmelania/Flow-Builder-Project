# Flow Builder Project

### Vision and background
The vision is to create an app that allows users to create custom flows for processes they use in their work.

As companies go through the digitalization process, they need to move their process to apps
that can help them automate and optimize their work.
Stakeholders need to create flows needed for their processes and be able to create new ones easily. At the same time, it is important to see analytics about their processes to see how they can adapt them.

### Project Overview
The Flow Builder Application enables users to construct linear workflows with different types of steps. These steps include Title, Text, Text Input, Number Input, Calculus, Display, Text File Input, CSV File Input, Output, and End steps. Users can create flows, add steps, manage inputs, navigate through steps, and analyze flow performance.

### OOP Concepts
Flow Builder is developed using object-oriented programming concepts to create a robust workflow management system. 

Classes and objects represent the steps, flows, and analytics. Encapsulation limits access to implementation details, and inheritance helps with code reuse, enabling the extension of base step classes to create specialized types. Polymorphism promotes flexibility, treating diverse step types within flows, and abstractization provides templates for implementations to facilitate the creation of generic structures. Exception handling ensures system stability by managing runtime errors during a flow execution. 

### Getting Started
To start using the Flow Builder project, follow these steps:

1. Download the "src" directory and unzip it.
2. Open the "main.cpp" file and run the application.
3. Create a new flow and add steps according to your requirements.
4. Configure each step with the necessary inputs and settings.
5. Analyze flow performance using the provided analytics tools.
6. Delete flows that are no longer needed to maintain a clean workspace.
